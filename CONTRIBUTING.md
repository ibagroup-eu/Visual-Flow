# How to contribute to Visual Flow

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

## Did you find a bug?

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
For more detailed information on submitting a bug report and creating an issue, visit our reporting guidelines.

## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch. Development team will be reviewing pull requests on regular basis and according to teamâ€™s priorities and bandwidth.
- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

## Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Visual Flow will not be accepted.

## Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

- Contact us via email: [VisualFlow@gomel.iba.by](mailto:VisualFlow@gomel.iba.by)
- Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.
